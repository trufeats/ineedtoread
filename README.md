Nothing interesting here!
I'm just experimenting with some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I ask ChatGPT for ideas.

I also send the PDFs I want to interact with on ChatGPT to this repo for easy access using the web link.

## Background Music

Drop `.mp3` files into the `music/` folder and list their filenames in
`music/playlist.json` as a JSON array, e.g.

```
["track1.mp3", "another-song.mp3"]
```

When the picker first runs, the tracks are shuffled and played in random
order, looping after all have finished.
